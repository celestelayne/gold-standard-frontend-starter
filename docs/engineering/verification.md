# Verification Protocol

**Status:** Draft v0.1  
**Last updated:** 2026-10-31

## Purpose

Define the checks and evidence required before human-written or AI-generated changes are considered complete.

An implementation is not verified simply because it compiles or an AI agent reports success.

## Verification Levels

### Level 1 — Static Checks

Required for every code change:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
```

### Level 2 — Automated Tests

Required for changes affecting application behavior:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Level 3 — Production Build

Required before merging:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Level 4 — Architecture Checks

Required once automated boundary enforcement is implemented:

```bash
pnpm architecture:check
```

### Level 5 — Browser and Visual Verification

Required for relevant user-facing changes:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

Review responsive behavior, keyboard navigation, loading states, error states, and visual fidelity.

## Current Verification Command

During initial scaffolding:

```bash
pnpm check
```

This runs the checks currently configured in `package.json`.

Do not assume tests or architecture checks are included until those scripts have been added.

## AI Agent Verification Contract

Before reporting completion, an agent must:

1. Identify which acceptance criteria were implemented.
2. Run relevant verification commands.
3. Report the actual results.
4. Identify any checks not executed.
5. Summarize changes and remaining limitations.

A failed or unexecuted check must not be represented as passing.

## Human Review

Human review is required for:

- Architectural changes
- New dependencies
- Security-sensitive changes
- Significant visual or interaction decisions
- Changes to approved specifications

## Failure Handling

When verification fails:

- Identify the failure and its likely cause.
- Fix the implementation rather than weakening tests.
- Re-run the relevant checks.
- Report unresolved failures explicitly.

## Validation

The verification protocol will be exercised against the Todo reference application and a fresh project generated from the template.
